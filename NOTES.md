Technical test
Taking the following API
- https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon?limit=151
We would like you to come up with a UI design of displaying the individual pokemon
and being able to flick through them but also being able to view them as a big list
and clicking into the individual pokemon with some of their stats.
Hints for getting their stats is on the https://pokeapi.co/ homepage.
We’re not going to judge on the best layout of code but it’s a bonus, we’re after the
best way of expressing yourself with a UI.
What to use??
It’s up to you what framework and styling package you want to use, let’s just see
what you can come up with!
Where to put the project??
If you can put it in a public github repo, that would be great! :)

Generation 1

Timespan: Ferbuary 27th 1996 - November 20th 1999
Number of new Pokémon: 151
Number of new Moves: 165
Region: Kanto

The first generation started in 1996 with the release of Pokémon Red & Green in Japan. The games were spearheaded by Satoshi Tajiri in Game Freak, first conceptualised as Capsule Monsters, before eventually becoming the Pocket Monsters, and then Pokémon, series that was released. On the idea of Shigeru Miyamoto, the games were split up into two to promote the trading and battling aspects of the game.

Following the release of the games in Japan, the popularity gradually increased and when released in the west in 1998, the Pokémon games became a full phenomenon. With 151 Pokémon, 165 moves and the two games to contend with, the games took off and many spin-off titles were released.
